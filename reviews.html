    <p>Elden ring's exploration is very boring.</p>
      <p>
        My rating (experience): 2/10
      </p>

        I heard of Elden ring several years ago when it was first released. I didint really think much about the game since I rarely play those type of "Soul like games."
        However after learning that it was supposedly very good from various reviewers and fans, I eventually decided to try it out some day. However because of the price i 
        decided not to buy the game. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My interest in the game peaked after i saw several edits of a character in the game on tiktok, that character was called marika. After seeing her i decided that 
        I wanted to really try out the game and grind my way to the end of the game. I was exited for the challanging boss fights and of the various weaponry and "builds"
        that were awaiting me. I finally bought the game when it was on discount during the steam summer sale. I got my ps5 controller, connected it to my pc and booted the game up.
        I was very excited for the game as I dont know anything about the lore and any of the mechanics, I therfore went into the game blind. After going through some 
        cave, I finally opend the door to the elden ring world. I then ventured out and got insta tapped by some dude on a horse. I followed the checkpoints and their directions
        and eventually arrived at some gate. I went inside and got killed by some troll. After failing to kill the troll because of skill issue, i decided to try to improve 
        my character and beat some enemies in order to level up my stats. After attacking and defeating the same enemies over and over agian, I was bored as I knew that 
        it would take many hours of the same tedious rinse and repeat farming to actually level up. I then called my elden ring friend and he told me that the main point 
        of the game was to explore the amazing world. So i gave up on farming to level up and tried to discover the world. This was when I was the most bored during this game.
        I had to go and do some horse riding simulator and travel across the maps. I didint find anything really interesting as I just saw boring enemies and some cool scenery.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I was at a loss of words at this point. I thought this was going to be a great game where I can really challange myself by defeating bosses and enemies and 
        also level up my gear and weapons. This was not the case, since I first had to go travel so much in nothingness and eventually progress by beating some 
        "dungeons" and "bosses". I went literaly blind into the game and did not know what I was supposed to even do in this game. No directions, no context, nothing.
        I was supposed to "explore" by myself. Yeah no, that shits boring and exploring some world was the last thing I wanted to do. I just wanted a linear path to 
        progess through the game, and not just ride on my horse and go into some random structures and beat some enemies.  
      </p>
  
      <P>
        So knowing how this was futile, I searched online on some of the most powerful weapons. I follwed some guide and got the weapon that was stashed in some random
        ass ruins in the other side of the map. However there was one problem. This supposed weapon had some requirements in some stats. Therefore I went back the starting point
        and whent to farm some souls or gems or whatever they are called in order to level up quickly. After 10 minutes I gave up and quit the game as this felt very boring.
      </P>
  
      <P>
        I can see why this game would be rated high for some people, however I felt like the exploring part was the most boring thing ever and that kept me away 
        from fully experincing the game. I dont really know what else there is to the game other than the difficulty of the game and the world building. I dont really
        think that the world is that good to allow this game to have such a high rating. Its probably only me since all my other friends have spend over a 100 hours in
        this game. 
      </P>
